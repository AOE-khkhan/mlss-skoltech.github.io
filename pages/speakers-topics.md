   bio: >
    I am a Senior Research Scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in the department of Empirical Inference and project leader in the department of 
    Physiology of Cognitive Processes at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. Neural networks are characterized by dense connectivity at multiple scales that makes 
    challenging to assess their organization and function. We develop machine learning and statistical tools to study the functional organization of these systems at multiple scales. 
    In parallel, the current intensive development of new artificial deep neural networks has lead to impressive successes, but the functioning of these architectures remains largely 
    elusive due to their high dimensional connectivity. This provides us an opportunity to use our network analysis tools to uncover fundamental principles for such systems, and possibly 
    relate them to biology. We are currently investigating causality and invariance principles to understand the structure of deep generative models and in particular assess their modularity.

   bio: >
    My research focus is on using kernel methods to reveal properties and relations in data. A first application is in measuring distances between probability distributions. 
    These distances can be used to determine strength of dependence, for example in measuring how strongly two bodies of text in different languages are related; testing for similarities 
    in two datasets, which can be used in attribute matching for databases (that is, automatically finding which fields of two databases correspond); and testing for conditional dependence, 
    which is useful in detecting redundant variables that carry no additional predictive information, given the variables already observed. I am also working on applications of kernel methods 
    to inference in graphical models, where the relations between variables are learned directly from training data.

   bio: >
    Joris M. Mooij studied mathematics and physics and received his PhD degree with honors from the Radboud University Nijmegen (the Netherlands) in 2007. 
    His PhD research concerned approximate inference in graphical models. During the next three years, he worked on causal discovery as a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for 
    Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen (Germany). In 2011 he obtained an NWO VENI grant, which allowed him to do a second postdoc, this time at the Radboud University Nijmegen. 
    In 2013 he became Assistant Professor at the Informatics Institute of the University of Amsterdam (the Netherlands). In the next years, he obtained an NWO VIDI grant and an ERC Starting 
    Grant, allowing him to start his own research group, consisting of 3 PhD students and 3 postdocs, focussing entirely on causal discovery. The research topics addressed by his group span 
    the entire spectrum from causal modeling, discovery, prediction, validation and application and combine mathematical, algorithmic, statistical and modeling aspects. In 2017 he was promoted 
    to Associate Professor. He has won several awards for his work.

   bio: >
    Marco Cuturi joined Google Brain, in Paris, in October 2018. He graduated from ENSAE (2001), ENS Cachan (Master MVA, 2002) and holds a PhD in applied maths obtained in 2005 
    at Ecole des Mines de Paris. He worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Tokyo, between 11/2005 and 03/2007. He worked in the financial 
    industry between 04/2007 and 09/2008. After working at the ORFE department of Princeton University between 02/2009 and 08/2010 as a lecturer, he was at the Graduate School of Informatics 
    of Kyoto University between 09/2010 and 09/2016 as a tenured associate professor. He then joined ENSAE, the french national school for statistics and economics, in 9/2016, where he still 
    teaches. His recent proposal to solve optimal transport using an entropic regularization has re-ignited interest in optimal transport and Wasserstein distances in the machine learning community. 
    His work has recently focused on applying that loss function to problems involving probability distributions, e.g. topic models / dictionary learning for text and images, parametric inference 
    for generative models, regression with a Wasserstein loss and probabilistic embeddings for words.

   bio: >
    I am a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Oxford, a tutorial fellow at St. Catherine's College, and the Chief Scientist and
    co-founder of Latent Logic Ltd. My research focuses on artificial intelligence. My goal is to design, analyse, and evaluate the algorithms 
    that enable computational systems to acquire and execute intelligent behaviour. I’m particularly interested in machine learning, with which 
    computers can learn from experience, and decision-theoretic planning, with which they can reason about their goals and deduce behavioural 
    strategies that maximise their utility. In addition to theoretical work on these topics, I have in recent years also focused on applying them
    to practical problems in robotics and search engine optimisation.
