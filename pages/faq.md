### Who can apply?
Early and mid stage PhD students. However, we will also consider strong applications by MSc students subject to space and availability. We also have a separate application category for postdocs, faculty and industry practitioners. Industrial applicants can also obtain tickets via industry sponsorship.
### When can I apply?	
The application system is open until the **6th of May 2019**. See the [application](/application/) page for more information on the process, and other important dates.
### How do I apply?
See please the [How to apply](/how-to-apply/) page.
### How should I arrange accommodation?	
See please the [travel](/travel/) page.
### What is the poster session?	
Posters are a long-standing tradition at the MLSS. Each applicant is asked to bring along a poster presentation covering some of their own work. 
While the day program covers broad areas of general interest, the poster sessions offer participants a chance to discuss their own work with their peers. 
The poster presentations will be a relaxed affair: Posters will be distributed across a room, with participants presenting to small groups of two or three standing in front of their posters.
### Does my poster need to be new work?
Posters can be both existing and unpublished work (ongoing work, or work resulting from undergraduate projects is also fine, were applicable). 
### Are there any Travel Grants or Scholarships for attending the Summer School?	
Full and partial (25%) stipends will be available to students with a strong profile and in need of financial support. Travel support covering accomodation will be offered to the best applications. Recipients will be informed of the details in their confirmation mail. Please, specify that you need financial support in the registration form. Your motivation letter should also provide details on your specific circumstances.
### I am not affiliated with any university or company currently. Can I still apply?	
Please write “None” in the affiliation field and provide additional details in your motivation letter. You will still need to provide a letter of reference.
### I live in Moscow, can I visit the school?
Registration is required for all participants. We will organize an open doors day for the community. Please check the page later for more information.
