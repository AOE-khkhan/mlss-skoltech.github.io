### What is the poster session?	
Posters are a long-standing tradition at the MLSS. Each applicant is asked to bring along a poster presentation covering some of their own work. 
While the day program covers broad areas of general interest, the poster sessions offer participants a chance to discuss their own work with their peers. 
The poster presentations will be a relaxed affair: Posters will be distributed across a room, with participants presenting to small groups of two or three standing in front of their posters.
### Does my poster need to be new work?
Posters can be both existing and unpublished work (ongoing work, or work resulting from undergraduate projects is also fine, were applicable). 
### Are there any Travel Grants or Scholarships for attending the Summer School?	
**Full and partial (25%) stipends** are available to students with a strong profile. <br/>
**Accomodation is covered** for the best applications. <br/>
Recipients will be informed of the details in their confirmation mail. <br/>
Please, specify that you need financial support in the registration form. <br/>
### I am not affiliated with any university or company currently. Can I still apply?	
Please write “None” in the affiliation field and provide additional details in your motivation letter. You will still need to provide a letter of reference.
### I live in Moscow, can I visit the school?
Registration is required for all participants. We will organize an open doors day for the community. Please check the page later for more information.
